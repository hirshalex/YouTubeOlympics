You are labeling YouTube videos.
Look at the examples, then follow the exact output format.

Examples:
Title: Simone Biles wins Olympic vault final
Tags: olympics, gymnastics
Label: olympic
Reason: about Olympic Games

Title: Melhores momentos: futebol brasileiro
Tags: futebol, gols
Label: other_sport
Reason: sports video, not Olympic

Title: New music video by pop star
Tags: music, official video
Label: non_sport

Now label this video. Respond only with the exact format and nothing else:
